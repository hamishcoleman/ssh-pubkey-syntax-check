Keeping a well maintained ssh known hosts database
==================================================

Introduction
------------

This check_syntax_ssh_known_hosts tool is one simple way to help keep
your known hosts file free of simple errors.

If you are keeping your ssh known hosts details in your configuration
management source repository (which is highly recommended) and you have
not yet scaled out and automated the entirety of your archtecture then
you may find that the simplest correct answer is to just have the raw
ssh known hosts file as something that is hand edited when the well-known
hosts need changing.

In that scenario, it is useful to have a syntax checker that will keep
errors from creeping into the file.
